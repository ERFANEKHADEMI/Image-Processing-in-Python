# Image-Processing-in-Python

Images are everywhere! We live in a time where images contain lots of information, which is sometimes difficult to obtain. This is why image pre-processing has become a highly valuable skill, applicable in many use cases. 

In this course, I have learned to process, transform, and manipulate images, even when they come in thousands. I have also learned to restore damaged images, perform noise reduction, smart-resize images, count the number of dots on a dice, apply facial detection, and much more, using scikit-image. 

After completing this course, I was able to apply my knowledge in my graduation project and many more.
